  "name": "In My Head",
  "description": "\"In My Head\" is the final single off of my new album \"Closure & Campari: After Hours.\"  I wrote the song as a reminder to myself to not overthink everything - control the controlables and move on. I produced the track myself and asked the talented LA artist, Carter Ace, to feature on it.  \n\nThis video is special to me because it was shot during the release show for the \"Closure & Campari: After Hours\" release party in LA on April 1st 2022, the very same day \"In My Head\" was released.  I had never performed this song live before and Carter Ace had agreed to come out as a surprise guest.  It's always exhilarating playing new music in front of a crowd, but this one took the cake.  The music video inter-splicing footage from that first live performance as well as b roll shot in the alleyway behind the venue.  The excitement of being able to capture this first performance on its release day shows through our performance and I'm really proud of this one. \n\nHope you dig!!!! <3 Aaron",
